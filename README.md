## Introduction

Some User Agents partition or double-key client-side storage mechanisms to prevent cross-site tracking. All of the specs which define client-side storage mechanisms need to be updated to reflect this.

This repository's [issue tracker](https://github.com/privacycg/storage-partitioning/issues) is where we're coordinating that effort. The actual spec changes will happen in each spec that defines a client-side storage mechanism.
